Preface — Mission & Mandate

The Protocol V.I.E. (Vector – Integrity – Execution) is created as the official digital framework and witness ledger of Vanuatu Investment Economics Limited (VIE).

Its mission is threefold:
Vector (Direction & Identity)
• To establish a clear and traceable direction of identity for every client, partner, and document.
• Each record under the Protocol is more than a file — it is a vector of trust, pointing to the rightful author, verified entity, or institution.
• The Protocol ensures that every interaction is not lost in digital noise, but anchored to a precise and recognized vector.
Integrity (Trust & Transparency)
• To guarantee integrity of records by providing a system of numbering, hashing, and witnessing that cannot be altered retroactively.
• Integrity is achieved through dual fixation:
• Public record (vie.one / vii.one, open to society).
• Internal record (partner systems, secured storage).
• This dual system creates a balance: openness for society, protection for clients.
Execution (Action & Proof)
• To transform abstract digital interaction into actionable proof.
• Every document issued under the Protocol is not just information — it is an executed act with legal, diplomatic, or commercial consequences.
• Execution means that once a Protocol document is published and hashed, it becomes binding, referenced, and permanent.

Purpose of the Protocol
• To serve as a digital notariat — a mechanism of witnessing, timestamping, and authenticating all records related to VIE’s activities.
• To unify three levels of transparency:
• Public documents (open to everyone).
• Semi-private documents (restricted access, under NDA).
• Classified documents (top secret, developed with experts).
• To provide clients and partners with unique identifiers (3–5 letters, default = 5), ensuring each document is tied directly to a verified entity.
• To integrate additional services (Blockchain fixation, NFT issuance, SEO promotion) that extend the authority and visibility of documents.
• To act as the Digital Embassy framework of VIE, bridging law, technology, and diplomacy.

Chapter I. General Principles

I.1 Mandate of the Protocol

The Protocol V.I.E. (Vector – Integrity – Execution) serves as the official digital notariat of Vanuatu Investment Economics Limited (VIE).
Its purpose is:
• To authenticate, timestamp, and witness all documents issued under VIE.

• To establish a transparent and verifiable framework for international operations in investment, trade, and citizenship.
• To provide a mechanism where every digital action becomes a record of trust, ensuring accountability and permanence.

I.2 Structure of Protocol Records

Every official document issued under the Protocol follows a strict format:

[IDENTIFIER]YYYYMMDDNNNNN[SUFFIX]

As follows:
• [IDENTIFIER] — three to five letters, assigned to the verified entity after KAIS verification.
• YYYYMMDD — date of issuance (year, month, day).
• NNNNN — sequential number of the document issued that day.
• [SUFFIX] — four to five additional letters (default = five), ensuring uniqueness and balance across the system.



Examples

Website: https://vie.one/#ABCOR2025082500001VIEQR



This structure guarantees that each Protocol record is:
• Unique.
• Directly tied to a verified identity.
• Impossible to duplicate or falsify without detection.

I.3 Anchor Hash Principle

• Every Protocol record contains a unique anchor hash, linking it directly to the official site via.one.
• The anchor hash is duplicated in the internal secured registry (partner servers), ensuring resilience and independence from external interference.
• This creates a dual verification system:
• Public Layer → visible confirmation of the document’s existence and authenticity.
• Internal Layer → hidden confirmation, legally valid and resistant to tampering.

The Anchor Hash Principle ensures that every Protocol document is both transparent to the public and secure under internal control.




Chapter II. VIE NFT Protocol (By NAZACODE)

II.1 Principle of NFT Registration

• If a document has a uniform (single-party) nature — e.g., a declaration, a policy, an attestation — it is fixed as one (1) NFT.
• If a document records a transaction or bilateral act — e.g., purchase–sale, service provision, or agreement — then two (2) NFTs are issued:
• One NFT for the provider (issuer of service/obligation).
• One NFT for the recipient (consumer of service/benefit).

II.2 Purpose of Dual NFT

• To ensure that both sides of the act have a separate, immutable digital witness of their role and rights.
• To create traceability: each NFT references the same Protocol record but carries a unique party anchor.

II.3 Legal Caveats

• Not all rights and obligations are legally transferable to third parties.
• Certain categories of documents fixed as NFT may carry restrictions under international law (e.g., personal identity, citizenship, notarized attestations).
• For these cases, VIE recognizes that further legal consultation is required before allowing transfer or assignment of NFT ownership.

II.4 Status

• This section of the Protocol is considered provisional.
• Additional rules and legal frameworks will be developed in cooperation with licensed legal experts to determine:
• Transferability of NFTs.
• Scope of rights attached to each NFT.
• Compliance with jurisdictional laws.

Chapter III. Legal & Witness Effect

III.1 Digital Notariat Function

The Protocol V.I.E. functions as a digital notariat, providing a trusted mechanism to:
• Timestamp every document.
• Certify its origin and authorship.
• Ensure that once issued, a document cannot be altered without breaking its reference code.

Each Protocol record is therefore equivalent to a digital act of witnessing. Just as a notary verifies a signature in the physical world, the Protocol verifies and secures documents in the digital world.

III.2 Jurisdiction & Trust

• The Protocol is designed to operate across multiple jurisdictions, respecting international standards of legal recognition and digital evidence.
• Public records (vie.one / vii.one) provide transparency to society.
• Internal partner records (compliance servers, secure ledgers) provide confidential validity for authorities, auditors, and legal professionals.
• This dual system builds trust:
• Public trust → everyone can verify a document’s existence.
• Institutional trust → regulators and courts can rely on secured internal evidence.

III.3 Execution Authority

• Once a Protocol document is issued and published with its anchor hash, it is considered executed.
• Execution means that the document is binding, referenced, and permanent within the Protocol.
• No further approval is needed for it to hold witness value:
• The anchor hash is the confirmation.
• The timestamp is the proof.
• The dual record is the guarantee.

Thus, the Protocol transforms every publication into an act with legal, diplomatic, or commercial weight.

Chapter IV. Publication Flow (Open Documents)

IV.1 Open Chain of Publication

For documents classified as Public, the Protocol defines a clear chain of publication across open social networks.
This chain ensures that each record is not only registered within the Protocol but also publicly witnessed through multiple layers of digital presence.

IV.2 Publication Path

The standard publication path for open documents is as follows:
Threads (Public Post) → The first release of the document, usually accompanied by a photo or image of the document and its reference code.
Instagram (Feed) → Automatic cross-post from Threads into Instagram, expanding reach to a wider audience.
Facebook Page → Direct publication from Instagram into the official Facebook Page of VIE.
X (Twitter) → Repost or report from Facebook, ensuring the record is mirrored into another global channel.
Instagram Stories → A mirrored publication of the X post, presented in a temporary but highly visible form.
Instagram Plus (Highlights / Archive) → Final step: archiving the Story into a permanent Highlights section, preserving it as part of the official record.

This sequence creates redundancy, continuity, and resilience in the publication flow.

IV.3 Principle of Multi-Layer Witnessing

• Each platform acts as a witness layer.
• By publishing the same document across multiple, interconnected channels, the Protocol ensures:
• Visibility → maximum reach for the public.
• Redundancy → no single point of failure; even if one platform fails, the record survives.
• Traceability → all posts can be cross-verified by time, code, and content.
• Together, these layers form the Digital Embassy Path: a chain of public witnesses confirming the authenticity and presence of the Protocol document.

IV.4 Official PDF Publication via Facebook

Facebook is the primary public channel for first-layer publication of Protocol records in photographic form.
We publish a photograph of the document (e.g., cover, seal/stamp, Reference ID, QR) — not the PDF file. The image itself functions as a time-stamped public witness and creates an auditable trail (post URL, share/repost history, comments).

Procedure
Capture/export a clear photograph showing the Reference ID and (where applicable) QR.
Post to the official Facebook Page of V.I.E.; include the Reference ID in the post text and, optionally, the public anchor (e.g., >https://vie.one/#).
Mirror to Stories / Highlights where appropriate to strengthen visibility and continuity.
For semi-private outreach, publish in closed professional groups (notaries, legal associations, verified partners) subject to NDA and group rules.

Rationale (Platform Uniqueness)
• Native, high-reach photo publication with durable public timestamps and share graphs.
• The visual post acts as a first public witness layer; canonical PDF and LinkedIn publication follow as separate, higher-formality layers.

Compliance
• Do not disclose personal data; watermark if needed.
• Ensure legibility of the Reference ID in both the image and the text.

IV.5 Official PDF Publication via LinkedIn

• All official Protocol documents are prepared and finalized in PDF.
• PDF is chosen as the international standard for legal, diplomatic, and commercial documents because it ensures:
• Universal readability
• Fixed, unalterable layout
• Options for protection and encryption




Process
After a document is finalized in PDF (including assignment of the Protocol Reference Number, optional password or access restriction, and digital signature/authenticity certificate in Acrobat).
The canonical PDF is uploaded to LinkedIn as the official publication platform.
Depending on the document’s level, it may be:
• Published openly in LinkedIn public posts, or
Shared within restricted LinkedIn groups (e.g., lawyers, notaries, verified partners).
The published PDF then becomes part of the official Publication Flow (e.g., after Facebook photo release or in semi-private channels).

Strategic role of LinkedIn
• Serves as the professional witness platform for finalized PDFs.
• Ensures visibility to a trusted, international professional audience.
• Supports both open recognition (public posts) and controlled circulation (restricted groups).
• Strengthens the evidentiary weight of Protocol documents through professional indexing and search visibility.

LinkedIn serves as the professional publication platform for finalized PDF documents.
After finalizing the PDF (with reference number, signature, access controls), upload it to the official V.I.E. LinkedIn page.

Depending on the document’s level, choose:
Public post for general visibility.
Restricted group(e.g., legal or notarial professionals) for controlled access.
LinkedIn provides a trusted professional witness layer—indexed, visible, and networked for peer verification.

Chapter V. Semi-Private Documents

V.1 Definition of Restricted Documents

Semi-private documents are those records which, while not classified as “Top Secret,” still contain sensitive information that cannot be openly shared with the public.
• They may include draft policies, attestations, internal agreements, or documents under professional/legal review.
• These documents require a restricted but controlled audience — trusted professionals, organizations, and verified partners.

V.2 Flow: Private Threads → Facebook (Closed Group)

The publication flow for semi-private documents follows a limited circulation path:
Private Threads Channel → initial upload of the photographic representation of the document.
Facebook Closed Group → direct repost from Threads into a private Facebook group.

This group is composed of:
• Leading civic organizations,
• Licensed notaries,
• International lawyers,
• Professional associations of legal experts.

V.3 Access Conditions

Access to the Closed Group is strictly conditional upon:
• Acceptance of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA),
• Acknowledgment of the group’s Privacy Policy and internal publication rules.

Only after these conditions are met may members view and interact with semi-private Protocol records.

V.4 Content Type (Photographic Only)

At this stage of semi-private circulation:
• Only photographic representations of documents (e.g., cover pages, stamps, attestation visuals) are shared.
• Full PDF documents remain restricted until further authorization or migration to the Classified Protocol flow.

This ensures that sensitive content is visible for witness purposes, but not fully disclosed.

V.5 Dual Witness Principle

Semi-private publication embodies the Dual Witness Principle:
• Public Layer → acknowledgement that the document exists and is visible to a limited professional circle.
• Private Layer → confidentiality is preserved by NDA and group rules, preventing unauthorized dissemination.

This balance ensures that restricted documents are trusted and verifiable without exposing sensitive content to the open public.

V.6 PDF Standard, Acrobat Fixation & LinkedIn (Semi-Private Flow)

• Semi-private documents, like public ones, are always finalized in PDF format.
• In Adobe Acrobat, the document is:
• Assigned a Protocol Reference Number,
• Digitally signed or certified (if applicable),
• Optionally encrypted and assigned a security number, ensuring confidentiality,
• Protected with a password or access restriction if required.
• This finalized PDF becomes the canonical version of the semi-private record.

Publication Path (Semi-Private):
The PDF is stored as the official record in the Protocol archive.
A photographic representation (cover, stamp, or attestation image) may be shared in Private Threads → Closed Facebook Group.
The full PDF may be uploaded into LinkedIn Closed Groups, accessible only to members who accepted NDA and Privacy Policy.

Strategic Role:
• Acrobat provides legal enforceability, encryption, and security numbering of semi-private documents.
• LinkedIn Closed Groups serve as the official professional platform for restricted PDF publication, mirroring the open logic of public documents but within a controlled environment.
Chapter VI. Classified Protocol (Top Secret Documents)

VI.1 Definition and Scope

Classified Protocol documents are records containing highly sensitive, confidential, or strategic information, where open or semi-private publication is strictly prohibited.
• Such documents may involve diplomacy, international agreements, national security, or client-critical operations.
• They represent the highest level of confidentiality within the V.I.E. Protocol system.

VI.2 Special Handling Rules

• Classified documents are not published in open or semi-private channels.
• Their creation, storage, and circulation require special security measures, including:
• Encryption and assignment of a dedicated security number,
• Storage in protected repositories with strict access control,
• Handling only by authorized personnel with appropriate clearance.
• Transmission of classified documents must occur exclusively through encrypted channels and only with explicit approval from the responsible authority.

VI.3 Status: Open for Expert Consultation

• At this stage, the handling of Classified Protocol documents is recognized as an open and evolving framework.
• Additional legal, diplomatic, and cybersecurity experts will be consulted to establish final and binding procedures for:
• Levels of classification,
• Access rights,
• Cross-border recognition of classified digital records.

VI.4 Interim Rule

Until formal procedures are completed:
• No document marked as Top Secret shall be released or circulated through digital witness channels (public or semi-private).
• Such documents remain strictly internal and under the authority of designated specialists.

Note (V.I.E. Position)
• Classified documents may also be received in an encrypted form.
• Even if V.I.E. does not hold the keys to decrypt and cannot access the semantic content of the document, the existence of the file — its symbols, metadata, or hash — allows the Protocol to:
• Register the document as an official record within the Protocol system,
• Fix it in blockchain if necessary,
• Assign an anchor hash and a unique security number.
• This ensures that the Protocol can serve as a witness to the existence of a document, even without direct access to its content.

Thus, the Protocol safeguards not only the information itself but also the fact of existence of a protected object, maintaining trust even under the highest level of secrecy.

Chapter VII. Additional Services — Blockchain & NFT

VII.1 Blockchain Fixation Service

• V.I.E. offers an additional service to register documents directly on blockchain.
• This creates an immutable, timestamped record that cannot be altered or deleted, providing enhanced evidence of authenticity.
• Blockchain fixation is optional but recommended for clients who require the highest level of digital permanence.

VII.2 NFT Certificate of Ownership

Third Variant — Public NFT
V.I.E. is mandated to issue a Public NFT in cases where the client does not operate a crypto-wallet, or for documents intended for broad public recognition.

This Public NFT is:
• Not assigned to any individual wallet,
• Published openly through V.I.E.’s official digital channels (vie.one / vii.one, LinkedIn, or other official witnesses),
• Permanently verifiable on blockchain.

It serves as:
• A universal proof of authenticity for journalists, observers, or third parties who do not engage with blockchain tools,
• An open-access certificate ensuring that the document is recognized as official even outside the crypto ecosystem.

Status Note:
The Public NFT remains bound to the V.I.E. Protocol itself and cannot be transferred. It functions solely as a publicly accessible anchor of authenticity.

VII.3 Dual Storage (Blockchain + IPFS/Penates)

• In addition to blockchain registration, every fixed document is also stored in a decentralized archive, such as IPFS, Penates, or an equivalent verified system.
• This ensures resilience and redundancy:
• Blockchain = immutable ledger,
• IPFS/Penates = distributed storage of the actual document file.
• Clients benefit from having their document preserved across multiple independent infrastructures.

VII.4 Service Fee & Delivery

• Blockchain and NFT services are provided for an additional fee.
• After payment and registration, the client receives:
• A confirmation report including the blockchain transaction ID,
• A link to the decentralized storage (IPFS storage),
• The NFT certificate, delivered directly to the client’s wallet.

VII.5 Legal & Witness Effect

• Blockchain fixation and NFT issuance provide a higher evidentiary value in legal and commercial contexts.
• The Protocol ensures that:
• Each NFT corresponds exactly to an official Protocol record,
• Each blockchain entry mirrors the reference number and anchor hash,
• Each decentralized copy guarantees access even if central systems are unavailable.

VII.6 Interoperability and External Recognition

• Blockchain and NFT records issued by V.I.E. are designed for interoperability.
• This allows external partners — legal associations, chambers of commerce, or international organizations — to verify authenticity directly through the blockchain entry or NFT certificate.
• Thus, V.I.E. NFTs function not only as internal proof but also as external gateways of trust.

Together, these services extend the Protocol’s function as a digital notariat into the realm of decentralized trust and permanence.

Chapter VIII. Additional Services — SEO Promotion

VIII.1 Purpose of SEO Promotion

• For documents classified as Public, V.I.E. offers an optional service of SEO promotion.
• The goal is to increase the visibility, ranking, and authority of the document across search engines and digital platforms.
• By maximizing reach, the document gains not only recognition but also greater evidentiary weight through public exposure.

VIII.2 Method of Execution

• SEO promotion is executed through:
• Optimized publication across official and partner websites,
• Targeted keyword indexing in relevant jurisdictions,
• Cross-linking to social media, press, and professional channels,
• Paid promotional campaigns where required.
• Campaigns can be tailored to specific locations, audiences, or languages, depending on client objectives.

VIII.3 SEO Effect (Digital Weight of the Document)

The more people view, reference, or engage with a document, the stronger its digital weight becomes.

High visibility leads to:
• Improved search engine ranking,
• Increased credibility and recognition of the record,
• Greater resilience of the Protocol witness effect (public confirmation by sheer visibility).

VIII.4 Service Fee

• SEO promotion is provided as an additional paid service.
• Fees depend on:
• Scope (local, regional, or global campaign),
• Duration of promotion,
• Selected platforms and strategies.
• Clients receive regular reports on campaign results, including impressions, reach, and SEO ranking data.

VIII.5 Result and Witness Effect

• Successful SEO promotion ensures that:
• The document becomes widely visible and easily traceable in public space,
• Its authority as a public witness record is reinforced by organic recognition,
• The Protocol achieves not only legal validation but also digital dominance.

Thus, SEO promotion transforms a Protocol record from a static file into a living digital footprint, continuously witnessed by society.

Chapter IX. Unique Identifiers (Technical Dossier)

Scope. This chapter formalizes the structure, lifecycle, and validation of Protocol V.I.E. identifiers. Chapter I introduced the concept (I.2). Here we define the operational rules used by public verifiers, partner systems, and internal registries.

IX.1 Purpose & Design Goals

Identifiers must:
• Uniquely bind each record to its issuing entity and issuance moment.
• Scale across large organizations and multi-division workflows.
• Survive copy/paste, OCR, and human transcription.
• Validate quickly (by humans and machines) without online access.
• Anchor to public and internal registries for dual verification.

IX.2 Canonical Format

Canonical serialization (no spaces):
[IDENTIFIER]YYYYMMDDNNNNN[SUFFIX]

Components (as follows):
• [IDENTIFIER] — 3–5 uppercase letters assigned to a verified entity after KAIS verification. Character set: A–Z only.
• YYYYMMDD — issuance date in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), 8 digits: year, month, day.
• NNNNN — five-digit daily sequential number (00001–99999), zero-padded; assigned per (IDENTIFIER, YYYYMMDD) and reset each UTC day.
• [SUFFIX] — 4–5 uppercase letters (default = 5). Derivation is deterministic from the anchor inputs (see IX.6) to provide integrity and collision resistance.

Readable display (optional, non-canonical):
IDENTIFIER YYYYMMDD NNNNN SUFFIX
(use monospaced font; canonical form must remain contiguous in machine contexts).

Regex (validation):
^[A-Z]{3,5}\d{8}\d{5}[A-Z]{4,5}$

IX.3 Sequence Allocation & Concurrency

• Unit of sequencing: (IDENTIFIER, YYYYMMDD) in UTC.
• Range: 00001–99999; 00000 is reserved (non-issuance / test / placeholder).
• Atomicity: sequence assignment is transactional to prevent race conditions under concurrent issuance.
• Departmental parallelism: each department/division may use its own IDENTIFIER (or sub-IDENTIFIER) so that parallel numbering streams never collide.
• Overflow policy: if a stream risks exceeding 99999 in a day, the issuer must provision additional IDENTIFIERs (e.g., per division) or throttle issuance; expanding sequence width requires a protocol amendment (future version).

IX.4 IDENTIFIER Policy (KAIS)

• Assignment: IDENTIFIERs are issued to verified entities following KAIS checks.
• Character set: A–Z only; avoid ambiguous triples (e.g., reserved words) as listed in the internal registry policy.
• Uniqueness: an IDENTIFIER cannot be reused by multiple legal entities simultaneously.
• Lifecycle: reassignment of a retired IDENTIFIER (if ever) requires a quarantine period and an explicit public notice.

Privacy note: never encode personal data or sensitive semantics in IDENTIFIERs.

IX.5 Date & Time Basis

• Date source: issuance system’s synchronized UTC clock (NTP-disciplined).
• YYYYMMDD reflects the day of finalization (when the record becomes canonical), not draft creation.
• Cross-border issuance: UTC avoids jurisdictional ambiguity and supports consistent sorting.


IX.6 SUFFIX Derivation & Integrity

Purpose. SUFFIX provides a compact, human-portable integrity signal linked to the anchor inputs.

Recommended derivation (deterministic):
Build the base string:
BASE = IDENTIFIER || YYYYMMDD || NNNNN || PUBLIC_ANCHOR
(where PUBLIC_ANCHOR is the canonical public URL or anchor string, e.g., https://vie.one/#).
Compute digest: H = SHA-256(BASE).
Encode: take the first bytes of H, Base32-encode (RFC 4648), remove padding.
Take the first 5 letters (A–Z) as the SUFFIX (map digits to letters if needed).

Default length = 5; 4 allowed for legacy compatibility.

This ties SUFFIX to the anchor and prevents silent tampering (a mismatched SUFFIX flags alteration). Implementations must replicate this logic to independently verify SUFFIX.

Optional check-letter: a mod-N checksum (e.g., Luhn mod 32) MAY be added as the last SUFFIX character in future versions; current v1.0 treats all SUFFIX letters as hash-derived.

IX.7 Anchor & Resolution

• Public anchor: canonical URL uses the fragment form: https://vie.one/#
Mirrors MAY exist (e.g., vie.one, vii.one) but the canonical pointer MUST be stable.
• Internal anchor: the same REFERENCE is stored in secured partner registries for legal enforceability.
• QR code: encode the full canonical URL in UTF-8; minimum error correction M (prefer Q for printed seals).

IX.8 Example (informative)

Reference: ABCOR2025082500001VIEQR
Website: https://vie.one/#ABCOR2025082500001VIEQR

Semantics:
• Issuer: ABCOR (KAIS-verified)
• Date: 2025-08-25 (UTC)
• Sequence: 00001 (first record for that issuer on that date)
• SUFFIX: VIEQR (hash-derived integrity letters)

IX.9 Validation Procedure (Verifier Checklist)

Given a candidate REFERENCE string:
	Syntax check: match the regex.
	Date check: YYYYMMDD is a valid UTC calendar day.
	Sequence check: NNNNN ∈ [00001..99999].
	SUFFIX check: recompute per IX.6 and compare.
	Anchor check: resolve https://vie.one/#; retrieve the public record metadata.
	Cross-check: optional verification against internal/partner registry (where permitted).
	Blockchain evidence (if present): confirm published hash/tx ID equals the public record’s anchor hash.

A failure at steps 1–4 indicates format/integrity error; failure at 5–7 indicates publishing/registry mismatch.

IX.10 Error Handling, Corrections & Revocations

• Clerical mistakes pre-publication: discard and reissue with a new sequence; never reuse the same NNNNN within the day.
• Post-publication erratum: issue a superseding record with a new REFERENCE; the original entry remains visible and is marked “SUPERSEDED” with a link to the replacement.
• Revocation: mark the record “VOID” (non-destructive); publish a signed revocation note referencing both the original and the cause.
• Audit trail: all state transitions (ISSUED → SUPERSEDED/VOID) are logged and, where applicable, fixed to blockchain.

IX.11 Machine Interfaces (Interoperability)

• Reference field name: vie_reference (string).

Schema hint (JSON):

{
"vie_reference":"ABCOR2025082500001VIEQR",
"public_anchor":"https://vie.one/#ABCOR2025082500001VIEQR",
"issuer":"ABCOR",
"date":"2025-08-25",
"sequence":"00001",
"suffix":"VIEQR",
“anchorhash":"<hex_sha256>",
"status":"ISSUED" // or SUPERSEDED/VOID
}

• Content embedding: when embedding in PDFs, store the REFERENCE in document metadata (XMP:vie_reference) and render it on the cover page with the QR code.

IX.12 Human Factors & Typography

• Fonts: prefer monospaced for printed references; avoid look-alike glyphs.
• Case: always uppercase.
• Spacing: avoid hyphens; if spacing is added for layout, never copy it into machine fields.
• Line breaks: do not split inside YYYYMMDD or NNNNN.

IX.13 Security Considerations

• No PII in IDENTIFIER or SUFFIX.
• Clock discipline: UTC time sources must be NTP-synchronized to avoid date boundary errors.
• Tamper signals: SUFFIX mismatch or anchor-hash mismatch must block acceptance in automated pipelines.
• Rate limits / anti-replay: issuance services should enforce authenticated access and log signer identity.

IX.14 Governance & Future Evolution

• Backwards compatibility: any future widening of fields (e.g., sequence length) will be introduced via a new Protocol version (e.g., v1.1) with dual-validation guidance.
• Reserved ranges: 00000 (sequence) and specific SUFFIX patterns may be reserved for tests/sandboxes; such references must never be published to public anchors.
• Change control: amendments to derivation (IX.6) or regex must be ratified and published as a Protocol update and mirrored to (vie.one / vii.one).

Result. With these rules, the Unique Identifier becomes a compact, self-validating key to each Protocol record—human-readable, machine-verifiable, and anchored across public and secured layers for maximum trust and scalability.

Chapter X. Elective (Voting) Documents

X.1 Definition

• Elective documents are a special category of Protocol records that are subject to collective approval through voting.
• They may include proposals, community guidelines, resolutions, or policy drafts that require validation not only by issuance but also by consensus of participants.

X.2 Voting Procedure

• Voting is organized on designated platforms that ensure transparency and accountability.
• Both individuals (natural persons) and entities (legal persons) may participate, depending on the scope of the document.
• Each participant casts a vote for or against the document, with voting rights defined by a separate regulatory framework.

X.3 Publication Flow

• The document is published in its draft form on official Protocol channels (vie.one / vii.one) and mirrored in electoral platforms (e.g., civic networks, professional associations, chambers of commerce).
• Voting is open for a specified period of time.
• After the vote concludes, the results are recorded in the Protocol as part of the document’s reference record.

X.4 Legal & Witness Effect

• Elective documents derive their authority not only from issuance but also from collective participation.
• The voting record itself becomes part of the document’s metadata, ensuring that the Protocol captures both:
• The document text, and
• The level of consensus it received.
• This mechanism makes elective documents a form of digital referendum within the Protocol framework.

X.5 Regulatory Note

• Detailed rules regarding:
• Eligibility of voters,
• Weight of votes (individual vs. institutional),
• Procedures for verification of participation shall be set out in a separate regulatory document.

X.6 Blockchain & NFT Integration for Voting Results

• The results of each vote may be fixed directly on blockchain, creating an immutable proof of participation and outcome.
• Each elective document may be linked to an NFT record that contains:
• The document text,
• The voting period and platform,
• The final tally of votes (for/against).
• This ensures that the consensus itself becomes part of the permanent Protocol record, not only the document.
• By combining collective participation with blockchain permanence, V.I.E. establishes elective documents as a unique model of digital referendum with verifiable trust.
